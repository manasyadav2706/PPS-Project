# PPS-Project

Student Details:
Name: Atharva Tanksale, Manas Yadav

The goal of this mini project was to create a simple ATM simulation using Python and PyQt5. It should have basic features like login, check balance, deposit, withdraw, and change PIN. I wanted to create something that feels like a real ATM but is still easy enough for a beginner student project.

Project Description:
This project is a basic ATM simulator made using PyQt5. It doesn't connect to any real bank, but it acts like a real ATM with a GUI. When the program starts, the user is asked to enter a 4-digit PIN. Once logged in, the user can check balance, deposit money, withdraw money, and even change the PIN. After changing the PIN, the user must log in again using the new one.
Main Features:
Login with PIN – Default PIN is 1234
Check Balance – Shows how much money is in the account
Deposit – Adds money to the account
Withdraw – Removes money if the balance is enough
Change PIN – Updates the PIN and logs out automatically
Exit – Closes the program
